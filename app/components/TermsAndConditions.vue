      </p>
      <h3>
        OVERVIEW
      </h3>
      <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. At AEN Connect, we follow a few fundamental principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We don’t ask you for personally identifiable information (defined below). That being said, your contact information, such as your phone number, social media handle, or email address (depending on how you contact us), may be collected when you communicate with us or if you report a bug or other error related to AEN Connect.</li>
        <li>We don’t share your information with third parties except to deliver you our Services and products, comply with the law, make AEN Connect better, protect our rights, or effectuate a business transfer.</li>
        <li>We’re not a huge, faceless corporation. We’re just developers trying to deliver an incredible product. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please reach out to us at support@aencoin.com.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        HOW YOU ACCEPT THIS POLICY
      </h3>
      <p>
        By using AEN Connect, including downloading one of our mobile applications, visiting our website, you agree to the use, disclosure, and procedures outlined in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h3>
        WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM OUR USERS?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The information we collect from you falls into two categories: (i) personally identifiable information (i.e., data that could potentially identify you as an individual) (“Personal Information”), and (ii) non-personally identifiable information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are) (“Non-Personal Information”). This Privacy Policy covers both categories and will tell you how we might collect and use each type.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do our best not to collect any Personal Information from AEN Connect users.  That being said, when using our Services, we do collect PUBlIC wallet addresses that you generate through AEN Connect. Further, we may collect some Personal Information from you when you communicate with us, including your contact information, such as your phone number, social media handle, or email address (depending on how you reach out).
      </p>
      <p>
        Like other online services, we also collect a variety of Non-Personal Information, including:
      </p>
      <p>
        Information you create through the AEN Connect’s website or mobile applications, including public wallet addresses.       Various analytics data, such as: (i) the IP address of the computer you use to access AEN Connect; (ii) the type of browser software you are using; (iii) the operating system you are using; (iv) the date and time you access or use AEN Connect; (v) the website address, if any, that linked you to AEN Connect; (vi) the website address, if any, you leave our website and travel to; and (vii) other non-personally identifiable traffic data.
      </p>
      <h3>
        HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION
      </h3>
      <p>
        When You Contact Us. <br >
        We may collect certain information if you choose to contact us, if you use our Services or if you report a bug or other error with AEN Connect. This may include contact information such as your name, email address, phone number, and public wallet address.  We, or companies that provide services on our behalf, may also collect certain Non-Personal Information from you, such as your locally hosted public wallet (a “Wallet”) addresses.<br >
        Information We Automatically Collect<br >
        Users who visit our website or use our application may have their device’s IP address logged for the purpose of generating anonymous statistics or troubleshooting the performance of our web servers. Your IP address will not be used to track or identify you, but may be used to determine your geographic location in order to determine which of our services you are presented with. Users of our website or mobile applications will receive an anonymous unique device id (“UDID”) for the purpose of identifying the device to AEN Connect servers. This UDID will not be tied to users’ identities, but will be used for debugging purposes and to differentiate devices when users access our Services using multiple devices.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Protection of Us and Others
      </h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to: comply with the law or a court order; cooperate with law enforcement; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of AEN Connect, our employees, our users, or others.
      </p>
      <h3>
        WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS OR CHANGE?
      </h3>
      <p>
        You can request access to the information we have collected from you. You can do this by contacting us at support@aencoin.com. We will make sure to provide you with a copy of the data we process about you. To comply with your request, we may ask you to verify your identity. We will fulfil your request by sending your copy electronically. For any subsequent access request, we may charge you with an administrative fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe that the information we have collected is incorrect, you are welcome to contact us so we can update it and keep your data accurate. Any data that is no longer needed for purposes specified in the “How We Use the Information We Gather” section will be deleted after ninety (90) days. Wallet addresses created through the AEN Connect application cannot be deleted from the Ethereum blockchain, therefore we are unable to delete this personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If at any point you wish for AEN Connect to delete information about you, you may contact us at support@aencoin.com.
      </p>
      <h3>
        DATA RETENTION
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you delete your Wallet or addresses from the AEN Connect Android mobile application, uninstall AEN Connect mobile applications from your device, or request that your information be deleted, we still may retain some information that you have provided to us to maintain AEN Connect or to comply with relevant laws.
      </p>
      <h3>
        DATA SECURITY
      </h3>
      <p>
        We are committed to making sure your information is protected and have selected third-party vendors which use the Ethereum network, including Coinbase, Shapeshift, and Changelly, that help keep your Personal Information safe. Unfortunately, we do not control these third parties and therefore cannot guarantee complete security.
      </p>
      <p>
        We employ several physical and electronic safeguards to keep your information safe, including encrypted user passwords, two factor verification and authentication on passwords where possible, and securing all connections with industry standard transport layer security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with all these precautions, we cannot fully guarantee against the access, disclosure, alteration, or deletion of data through events, including but not limited to hardware or software failure or unauthorized use. Any information that you provide to us is done so entirely at your own risk.
      </p>
      <h3>
        CHILDREN
      </h3>
      <p>
        We are especially sensitive about children’s information. Our Services are not targeted towards children, and we don’t knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, we will treat any information that you provide us while using AEN Connect on behalf of your minor child as Personal Information as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions concerning our information practices with respect to children, or if you learn that a child under the age of 13 has used AEN Connect, created a user account, or provided us with personal information, please email us at support@aencoin.com
      </p>
      <h3>
        ONLINE TRACKING AND HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
      </h3>
      <p>
        Online tracking is the collection of data about an individual’s Internet activity used to deliver targeted advertisements and for other purposes. Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If an online service elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the service may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website operators, including AEN Connect, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit http://allaboutdnt.com.
      </p>
      <h3>
        CHANGES AND UPDATES TO PRIVACY POLICY
      </h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to update and revise this privacy policy at any time.  We occasionally review this Privacy Policy to make sure it complies with applicable laws and conforms to changes in our business. We may need to update this Privacy Policy, and we reserve the right to do so at any time. If we do revise this Privacy Policy, we will update the “Effective Date” at the bottom of this page so that you can tell if it has changed since your last visit and will do our best to notify you.

      </h3>
